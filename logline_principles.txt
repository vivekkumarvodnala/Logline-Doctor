--- PRINCIPLE 1: PROTAGONIST & ADJECTIVE (THE WHO) ---
A strong logline must introduce a memorable protagonist and give them a compelling, often contradictory, adjective. The audience needs to know who we're focusing on.
BAD: A scientist invents something.
GOOD: A naive, but brilliant paleontologist accidentally unearths a living dinosaur egg...

--- PRINCIPLE 2: GOAL & CONFLICT (THE WHAT) ---
The logline must clearly state the protagonist's immediate goal and the primary obstacle (conflict or antagonist) standing in their way. The conflict must be dynamic.
BAD: A police officer investigates a crime.
GOOD: A jaded, disgraced detective must race against time to capture a serial killer who uses cryptic clues from classic literature to choose his victims...

--- PRINCIPLE 3: HIGH STAKES (THE WHY) ---
The stakes define what the protagonist will lose if they fail. This must be universal (the world, the city) or extremely personal (their life, their child, their soul). No stakes = no story.
BAD: He has to deliver a package.
GOOD: A simple delivery man must transport a nuclear warhead across a post-apocalyptic wasteland, knowing the fate of the last human city rests on his success...

--- PRINCIPLE 4: IRONY / THE HOOK ---
The best loglines often feature a touch of irony or a clear "hook"—a unique twist on a familiar setup. This is what sells the movie.
GOOD: A veteran bank robber discovers that the bank he's robbing is currently being robbed by a different, more ruthless crew.
